# PACT - Protein Analysis and Classifier Toolkit

Note: This will replace all deep sequencing code under user:JKlesmith. It is a clean re-write of all of the current code within user:JKlesmith to move from Python 2.7 to Python 3.4 and above. The goal of this project is to enable a Deep Sequencing pipeline to convert FASTQs to a Fitness Metric then analyze classifiers.
